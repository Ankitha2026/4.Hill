#Problem 4:
#Array of integers is a hill, if:

#it is strictly increasing in the beginning; after that it is constant; after that it is strictly decreasing.
#The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.
#For example, the following three arrays are a hill: [5,7,11,11,2,1], [4,4,2], [7],
#but the following three are not unimodal: [5,5,6,6,1], [1,2,1,2], [4,5,5,6].

#Write a program that checks if an array is a hill.

#Input Format

#The first line contains integer n (1<=n<=100) — the number of elements in the array.

#The second line contains n integers a1,a2,...,an (1<=ai<=1000) — the elements of the array.

#Output Format

#Print "yes" if the given array is a hill. Otherwise, print "no".
